This plug-in uses the 2html.vim script included with Vim's runtime files to publish a collection of syntax highlighted files as HTML documents and then replaces identifiers such as function and variable names in the HTML output with hyper links (based on available tags as generated by Exuberant Ctags). The result is a directory (tree) of syntax highlighted, interlinked HTML documents. I've published the plug-in's source code as a demonstration at http://peterodding.com/code/vim/profile/plugin/publish.vim. For more information about the plug-in please refer to its homepage or the project page on GitHub:
